# Regression Analysis on Board Games Dataset
In this project, we have a board games dataset from the weekly Tidy Tuesday event. The dataset contains 10,532 board games with at least 50 ratings between 1950 and 2016. A more detailed description of the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-12)

The goal of this project is to perform a regression analysis on the board games dataset and build a model to predict the average ratings of the games.
